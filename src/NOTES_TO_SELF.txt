1.  Each router multicasts a request packet on waking up for the first time
2.  On receiving a packet with command = REQUEST (1) - All neighbors respond with their routing table to that particular router,
    this new router fills in its routing table
3.  Rule for filling in the table -
    A. access the incoming routing table
    B. for each DESTINATION ROUTER entry in the new routing table, check for a corresponding entry in the current routing table -
        3.1. If not found then add as is
        3.2. If found, then check if the NEXT HOP of the entry in the CURRENT table equals the incoming router network address
        3.2.1   If YES, then just overwrite the current cost as (1 + incoming cost) even is the incoming cost is greater then the current cost
        3.2.2   If NO, then the current cost = min(current, d(i, k) + D(k, j)) = min(current, 1 + D(k, j))
3.  Add CIDR addressing support inside routing table
4.  Add the timeout table (last updated time) which contains the last updated time for each network. If at any point this times out for
    a given network, then mark the cost to that network as 16
5. Convert packet to byte stream
